Star Mania is an arcade spaceship game that is playable online through Codeskulptor. I was inspired to create this game when I read about Elon Musk's story of selling his own arcade game to a local store. Working on the project helped me familiarize myself with Python and many types of data structures, such as hashmaps, heaps, stacks, queues, and linked lists, sets, and tuples. I also designed and modified the sprities used for the game's animations using adobe tools along with Blender and MAYA. As a challenge, instead of using the Pygame library which is common for game development, I decided to build my own physics engine with hitbox models and 2D collision physics, which requried an unhealthy amount of math haha. You can give the game a try by clicking on the "Play Game" button below.
