Syrinx is a malignant cyst detecting neural network I built. I created Syrinx because I have always had a love for biology along with engineering, and this project enables me to integrate my hobby with my passion, while also trying my best to help others by releasing this as an open service for free use to assist with medical diagnosis if useful. A cyst is a node of membranous tissue that contains fluid, air, and other substances made up by a cluster of cells. They are able to grow nearly anywhere on the human body, resembling a liquid filled lump, and are often associated with cancerous tumors. However, the vast majority of cysts are benign, meaning they are harmless in effect, while a small percentage with key features are malignant, meaning they are harmful in effect and could lead to diseases and dangerous tumors.

I created this neural network using TensorFlow, NumPy, and published medical imaging on malignant and benign cysts. I code my program in TensorFlow to combine machine learning and deep learning to parse through the thousands of pre-labelled MRI images and train my neural network against it. During the analysis of each image, NumPy works in conjunction to perform multi-dimensional matrix calculations with the results generated from my TensorFlow program. After analyzing an image, Syrinx will output a percentage chance that the cyst pictured is malignant or benign, with a near 70% accuracy rate. As I continue to improve Syrinx through more data sets, it will be able to continue to improve both its accuracy and precision in detecting malignant cysts.
