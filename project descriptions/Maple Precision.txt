Maple Precision is a geospatial mapping software startup that is located in the Velocity Garage as part of their accelerator program. I have working at Maple Precision since the beginning of this year as a software engineering intern. Since joining, Maple Precision I have lucky enough to learn and work on a varitey of technologies, from algorithims and databases, to cloud servers and fullstack development. The tech stack that I have personally worked with include: Amazon Web Services, WebGL, Potree, Chart.js, React, Entwine, Java, and Python. I've also gained great experinece with software collaboration through using GitLab for source control, trello for agile scrum, and slack for team communication.
