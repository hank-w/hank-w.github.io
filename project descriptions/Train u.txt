Train u is a machine learning sports trainer program that helps people improve their form when playing sports or excercising by analyzing and comparing their motion to professional players of their choosing and suggesting improvements. Train u was made at a UofT Scarborough hackathon called Hack the Valley with two of my friends. Our program was able to place 3rd out of over 100 teams at the event. Though the event has finished, the project is still ongoing as we believe that the program could see practical real life applications in helping people play like their favourite players.

The program is able to provide accuracte diagnostics and suggestions through combining two machine learning algorithims in conjunction. The first machine learning algorithim anaylzes footage of a person in motion and through the use of complex matrices and eigen vector chasing, is able to map a skeletal body onto the person. The second machine learning algorithim then compares the new video footage with skeletal bodies of a professional athele with any person, rapidly recording inconsistencies between the two models and parsing through the data after the video ends to suggest improvements in specific body part movements, such as "raise hand when releasing ball".
