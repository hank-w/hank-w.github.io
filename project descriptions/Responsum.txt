Responsum is an educational Classroom application I'm developing to try to help students improve their academic learning by integrating and centralizing software tools and assistants across platforms. As a student myself, I found that having to navigate to five websites or mobile apps each time I wanted to study with all the resources availible to me was quite a hassle, espcisallly considering how limited time we have when working on schoolwork, projects, and design teams. Along with this issue, each application also levied a charge either towards the student or the university, that stacked up to over $200 per student, times the 40,000 students we have at the University of Waterloo.  To try and find a solution to this problem, I decided to try and create a web app and mobile app that would seek to optimize the essential resources required for a great academic experience, and also add in additional features that my friends and I personally wished for.

The development consists of three compoenents, the web app, the mobile app, and the API. I'm using MongoDB for my database, Node.js for the backend, and Google Cloud Servers, with a plan to migrate to the University of Waterloo's secured servers soon. I'm also using React, JavaScript, and HTML for my front end, along with Flutter for IOS and Android mobile applications.

I would also like to extend a huge thanks to my data structures and algorithims professor, Igor Ikovic, for giving me great advice on pursing my project and helping support its launch through a potential in class trial run next term with a mechatronics class of 135 students. Professor Ikovic is also an excellent teacher and has taught our class many fundementals of computer science that have enabled me to make this project and make it reality.
